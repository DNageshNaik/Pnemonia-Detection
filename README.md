# Pnemonia-Detection
The appearance of pneumonia in X-ray images is often unclear, can confuse with other diseases, and can behave like many other abnormalities.Therefore, We have created a deep learning model to help radiologists for diagnosing pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The objective of this model is draw a bounding box on each of the pneumonia opacities 

Devised a Deep Learning Model to automatically locate lung opacities in chest radiographs, Used Data Augmentation to reduce data imbalance; Histogram Equalization to improve image contrast, Achieved highest accuracy of 95% using Mask RCNN after employing various CNN Architectures
